        "Q1] What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes.\n",
        "     It is used to structure programs by grouping related data and behaviors together, making code more modular, reusable, and easier to manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2]  What is a class in OOPS?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and\n",
        "     behaviors (methods) that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3]  What is an object in OOPS?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with state (data/attributes) and behavior (methods/functions).\n",
        "     When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4]  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Abstraction is hiding unnecessary details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
        "     Whereas encapsulation is wrapping data and methods together and restricting direct access to data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5]   What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Dunder methods are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (__method__). These methods enable operator overloading,\n",
        "     custom object behavior, and interaction with built-in Python functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6]  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPS.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class (child class) to inherit properties and methods\n",
        "     from another class (parent class). This promotes code reusability and hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7] What is polymorphism in OOPS?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Polymorphism is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a\n",
        "     common superclass. It enables a single interface to be used for different types of objects, making code more flexible and extensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8] How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that restricts direct access to certain attributes and methods,\n",
        "     protecting the internal state of an object. It is achieved by hiding data using access modifiers and providing controlled access via methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9]  What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__, which is automatically executed when an object of a class is created.\n",
        "     It is used to initialize the attributes of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10] What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- A class method is bound to the class, not an instance. It can modify class-level attributes but cannot modify instance attributes directly.\n",
        "     whereas a static method does not modify class or instance attributes. It behaves like a regular function but belongs to a class for logical\n",
        "      grouping.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11] What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Method Overloading allows multiple methods in a class to have the same name but different parameters. In some languages like Java and C++,\n",
        "     method overloading is directly supported. However, Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense because functions/methods\n",
        "     can only have one definition at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12] What is method overriding in OOPS?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Method Overriding is a key feature of polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a subclass to provide a different\n",
        "     implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13] What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The property decorator in Python is used to define getter, setter, and deleter methods in a class. It allows controlled access to an\n",
        "     attribute while still enabling attribute-like access (without calling a method explicitly).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14] Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects\n",
        "     of a common superclass. It enables code flexibility, scalability, and reusability by allowing the same interface to be used for different\n",
        "     types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15] What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It typically contains one or\n",
        "     more abstract methods, which must be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16] What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) provides a structured and modular approach to programming, making code more reusable, maintainable,\n",
        "     and scalable. It revolves around objects and classes, enabling efficient code organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17] What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Class variables are shared across all instances of the class and defined inside the class but outside any method but instance variable is\n",
        "     unique for each instance (object)Defined using self.variable_name inside the __init__() method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18]  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python that allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class. This means that a child class\n",
        "     can have attributes and methods from multiple base classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19]  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- __str__ returns a human-readable string representation of an object whereas __repr__ returns an official (debugging) string representation\n",
        "     of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20] What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class (superclass) inside a child class. It helps in method inheritance\n",
        "     and avoids redundancy when working with class hierarchies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21] What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The __del__ method is a special dunder (double underscore) method in Python, also called the destructor. It is automatically called when an\n",
        "     object is about to be destroyed, allowing cleanup operations like closing files, releasing resources, or logging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22] What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- A static method does not receive an implicit reference to the instance (self) or the class (cls).It works just like a normal function but\n",
        "     belongs to the class for organizational purposes.\n",
        "           Whereas  A class method receives a reference to the class (cls) instead of an instance (self).It can modify class-level attributes\n",
        "     and create new instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23] How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Polymorphism is an object-oriented programming (OOP) concept that allows different classes to use the same method name but perform different\n",
        "     behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ \"One interface, multiple implementations.\"\n",
        "✅ Polymorphism helps in writing flexible and reusable code.\n",
        "✅ It is mainly achieved using method overriding in Python inheritance.\n",
